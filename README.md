The tool rental website will be a pseudo-storefront, providing the user with visuals of each tool, pricing information for renting tools, and terms and conditions for renting the tools. It will not deal with returning or replacing tools, or managing or maintaining revenue history. There will be three linked pages, one for the main page, one for pricing information, and one for terms and conditions. Styling and colors will be done with CSS and no JavaScript will be used during this phase.
Phase II of the tool rental website will be a continuation of Phase I and will consist of adding JavaScript to the already made static pages. The page with the bulk of the change in this phase is the main page. Static descriptions and links to longer descriptions will be changed to modals that will pop up when the name of the tool/picture is clicked. Below the clickable pictures will be a drop-down form to select a tool (see implementation) and a form to select the date of return. Underneath all that will be a submit button. If both fields have something in them, when the submit button is clicked, a modal will pop up with the information about the rental and the date due to be returned.
